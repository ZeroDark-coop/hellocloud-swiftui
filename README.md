# Hellocloud - ZeroDark starter samples

 ZeroDark.cloud is an open-source framework you can integrate into your app. It provides zero-knowledge sync & messaging. And zero-knowledge means real security.  As in, it's impossible for the server to read any of the content generated by your app, because all data is encrypted client-side using keys the server doesn't know. The industry calls this zero-knowledge, or end-to-end security. And now you can easily add this security to your app.
